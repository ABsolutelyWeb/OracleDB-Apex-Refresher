GROUPING FUNCTIONS

	- In dealing with single rows, if we are working with single row functions, getting 4 single 
	  rows would yield in an output of 4 single rows.
	  
	- Grouping functions are different. Rather than taking 4 rows and outputting 4 rows, grouping
	  functions take 4 rows and output 1 row as a "super row" or a collection of rows. Examples
	  of grouping functions include COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX / MIN. They take many rows and output 
	  a single collection of rows.
	  
	  NOTE: 

		- SQL query order:
			1. SELECT
			2. FROM
			3. WHERE
			4. GROUP BY
			5. HAVING
			6. ORDER BY
